This is a part of bigger project of node examples that you can find at [github.com/andyj/node-example](https://github.com/andyj/node-example).

Its quite straigh forward, it takes a path of the CSV to parse via the command line call e.g. `$ node app.js /PathTo/Your.csv` and outputs the contents (an array) to the console.

** n.b. This is Gist might be out of date as I couldn't find a way to include the [app.js file](https://github.com/andyj/node-example/blob/master/csvparse/app.js) directly from the [Github project](https://github.com/andyj/node-example/tree/master/csvparse). **
