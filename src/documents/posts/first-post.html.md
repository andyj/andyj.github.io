I've been working on getting a static blog together since the 2012/2013, with the original idea being to
export my whole Blog using node which is something I did at [https://github.com/andyj/blogcfc2html]. Though the idea of importing 1000+ posts in to a shinny new blog along with issues like broken links to images and external resources never sat well with me. I then saw [Sean's post](http://www.corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/the-blog-is-dead-long-live-the-blog) and figured I'd steal the idea of leaving the old site as-is as an archive and move on.

So here I am, now pushing static pages to Github via [docpad](http://docpad.org/). This will also be linked to my [feedburner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/andyjarrett) if anyone still subscribes via RSS?
