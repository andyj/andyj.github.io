For anyone just starting in node.js or playing around with it I am added my exmaples to a github project at [github.com/andyj/node-example](https://github.com/andyj/node-example).

Currently there are only 3 examples but feel free to send push requests or suggestions on where I've gone wrong

* Sessions in Node.js https://github.com/andyj/node-example/tree/master/sessions
* MySQL & Node.js https://github.com/andyj/node-example/tree/master/db-mysql
* Parsing CSV data with Node.js https://github.com/andyj/node-example/tree/master/csvparse
