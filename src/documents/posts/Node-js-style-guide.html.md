Node.js style [github.com/felixge/node-style-guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) to help you/team keep consistent which I'm happy about as it generally follows a style I prefer

* 2 Spaces for indention
* Use Semicolons
* Use single quotes, unless you are writing JSON.

* Declare one variable per var statement **< you know it makes sense**
* Use lowerCamelCase for variables, properties and function names
